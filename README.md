# Weishaupt.js - Poor man's Ambilight ðŸª”

Adds a halo effect around your video player. It's not as good as Ambilight, only in a browser, but it's free.

Named after the founder of the Illuminati, [Adam Weishaupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt).

Demo is available at [weishauptjs.vercel.app](https://weishauptjs.vercel.app).

**Note:** This is a proof of concept. It's not optimized for performance. And there are still some issues with purely black parts of the video.

<script src="weishaupt.js"></script>
